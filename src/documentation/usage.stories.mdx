# Usage

You can use any of the components as demonstrated in the documentation. Please refer to each component's demo page.

## Quick start

Here's a quick example to get you started:

```tsx
import {} from '@elonkit/react/lib/overrides';

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import { ThemeProvider, EmptyState } from '@elonkit/react';
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';

const Application = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Button variant="contained">Hello World</Button>
      <EmptyState heading="There are no entities yet" subheading="Do you want to create the first entity?" />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<Application />, document.querySelector('#root'));
```

Then follow the usage instructions for [MUI](https://mui.com/getting-started/usage/). You may also want to see
documentation for [server rendering](https://mui.com/guides/server-rendering/).

## Typescript

There are three ways to load the types overrides for MUI.

The easiest one, if your `tsconfig.json` already has a `"types"` array in the `"compilerOptions"` section, is to add
`"@elonkit/react/lib/overrides"` to the `"types"` array.

Alternatively, a specific import syntax can to be used from a typescript file. This module does not exist in reality,
which is why the `{}` is important:

```ts
import {} from '@elonkit/react/lib/overrides';
```

It is also possible to include it through a triple-slash reference:

```ts
/// <reference types="@elonkit/react/lib/overrides" />
```

Either the import or the reference only needs to appear once, anywhere in the project.
